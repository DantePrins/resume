## Research Assistant in the Neutral Atom Trap group at TRIUMF

### TRINAT report
This report was written at the end of the term as a summary of the project, a presentation of the final data, and what further should be done in the lab. It was sent to the lab group and reviewed with their feedback. In future this document will be referenced by members of the lab group, particularly future students regarding the finding of this project and a collection of some of my knowledge from the term. 

### TRIUMF presentation
I gave this presentation to a room of undergrads along with my lab group but the intended audience for the tone is the former. This was given about two weeks before the end of the term so not everything on the report is included and I took time to explain more basics that were omitted from the report. 

## Undergraduate Researcher at the Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute

### Fe3GeTe2 decapping final talk slides
These are the slides for the talk I gave to a general audience at the SBQMI as a summary of my summer work. The results and data here are more engaging for audiences without experience looking at RHEED images and gives an introduction to the project. These slides are meant to accompany my talk, but should still be meaningful alone.

### Fe3GeTe2 decapping trials
These slides present data, primarily RHEED images paired with treatments descriptions, of each stage of all the trials in this project. Additional data such as XRD scans and AFM images are also included when collected. Conclusions for the project are included on the final five pages (if you can get to them).  This is not quite a logbook, with minor details such as substrate treatment conditions and cell temperatures being ommited, but presents a timeline and results for each of the trials of the project. 


## Software Engineer at the Centre for Heart Lung Innovation

### Small Airway Reduction and Fibrosis Is an Early Pathologic Feature of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis published in ATS
I worked on this publication during and after my time at HLI before it being published in 2021. I was the primary author for online suppliments 2 and 3 as the creator of the roughness and curviness metrics and main software engineer which these sections discussion.

### Roughness + Curviness Lab Presentation 
This was one of the final lab presentations I gave during my four months at HLI. It discusses the process and justifcation for the development of two parameters I developed to help charactise the level of disease present in lung samples from CT scans. This work is being incorperated into larger manuscripts on COPD and IPF lung disease which we hope to publish in the next couple of years. 

### ASA2.0.0 user manual
I spent about three months of my time at HLI implementing features and improving this ImageJ plugin which is used as the primary analysis program in the lab. I reworked much of the program behind the hood, about ~50% new code, along with numerous new features I was directed to add by researchers in the lab. 

## ENPH253 Autonomous Can Collection Robot

### Robot Summer Recap
This is a presentation of my design made for the ENPH253 robotics competition. The robot was designed with the limitations of household and store bought materials and tools. Our team scored 7th of 16 teams in the competition, with my robot being the highest scoring copy built by each of our teammates.

### Robot Proposal
This proposal was put together by myself and my two teamates before we each began serious construction of our robot. 
In particular, I was responsible for mechanical prototyping, kinematic calculations for things like turning, and PCB design. 


## President of the UBC Water Polo Club

### 2020 UBC Water Polo Covid-19 Safety Plan
This safety plan was drafted for the fall 2020 between myself and the president of Vancouver Seniors Water Polo. This document integrated safety guidelines provided by the provincial goverment as well as the aquatic facility with the unique sport of water polo in mind. 

## Force sensing model

### This report summarizes the methodology and uses of this coded 2D force sensor model.
