## Robot Summer Recap
This is a presentation of the design made for the ENPH253 competition also known as Robot Summer. My robot was designed with the limitations of household and store bought materials and tools. Our team scored 7th of 16 teams in the competition, with my robot being the highest scoring copy built by each of our teammates.
