## ASA2.0.0 user manual
I spent about 3 months of my COOP implementing features and improving this ImageJ plugin which is used as the primary analysis program in our lab. I reworked much of the program behind the hood, about ~50% new code, along with numerous new features I was directed to add by researchers in the lab. 

## Pulmonary Fibrosis Abstract
This abstract is for a manuscript I contributed to both the research and authoring of on my previous COOP(2020) at The Centre For Heart Lung Innovation in the Hogg lab. 
The manuscript will soon be submitted to The American Thoracic Society for review and publication.

## Robot Proposal
This proposal was put together by myself and my two teamates before we each began serious construction of our robot. 
In particular, I was responsible for mechanical prototyping, kinematic calculations for things like turning, and PCB design. 

## Robot Summer Recap
This is a presentation of the design made for the ENPH253 competition also known as Robot Summer. My robot was designed with the limitations of household and store bought materials and tools. Our team scored 7th of 16 teams in the competition, with my robot being the highest scoring copy built by each of our teammates.

## Roughness + Curviness Lab Presentation 
This was one of the final lab presentations I gave on my COOP term. It discusses the process and justifcation for the development of two parameters I developed to help charactise the level of disease present in lung samples from CT scans. This work is being incorperated into larger manuscripts on COPD and IPF lung disease which we hope to publish in the next couple of years. 


## Cross sections manuscript contribution 
This document is an example of one of the figures and text I created for the manuscript. It is still in rough form, to be integrated into a larger document.
It explains how cross sections of lung airways can be obtained from a mask of the original CT scan. Considerable care was taken into how wide a range should be used to determine the local direction of airways, which is discussed in the document.
