### Fe3GeTe2 decapping final talk slides
These are the slides for the talk I gave to a general audience at the SBQMI as a summary of my summer work. The results and data here are more engaging for audiences without experience looking at RHEED images and gives an introduction to the project. These slides are meant to accompany my talk, but should still be meaningful alone.

### Fe3GeTe2 decapping trials
These slides present data, primarily RHEED images paired with treatments descriptions, of each stage of all the trials in this project. Additional data such as XRD scans and AFM images are also included when collected. Conclusions for the project are included on the final five pages (if you can get to them).  This is not quite a logbook, with minor details such as substrate treatment conditions and cell temperatures being ommited, but presents a timeline and results for each of the trials of the project. 

## ENPH253 Autonomous Can Collection Robot

### Robot Proposal
This proposal was put together by myself and my two teamates before we each began serious construction of our robot. 
In particular, I was responsible for mechanical prototyping, kinematic calculations for things like turning, and PCB design. 

### Robot Summer Recap
This is a presentation of the design made for the ENPH253 competition also known as Robot Summer. My robot was designed with the limitations of household and store bought materials and tools. Our team scored 7th of 16 teams in the competition, with my robot being the highest scoring copy built by each of our teammates.

### Cross sections manuscript contribution 
This document is an example of one of the figures and text I created for the manuscript. It is still in rough form, to be integrated into a larger document.
It explains how cross sections of lung airways can be obtained from a mask of the original CT scan. Considerable care was taken into how wide a range should be used to determine the local direction of airways, which is discussed in the document. 

### Roughness + Curviness Lab Presentation 
This was one of the final lab presentations I gave during my four months at HLI. It discusses the process and justifcation for the development of two parameters I developed to help charactise the level of disease present in lung samples from CT scans. This work is being incorperated into larger manuscripts on COPD and IPF lung disease which we hope to publish in the next couple of years. 

### ASA2.0.0 user manual
I spent about three months of my time at HLI implementing features and improving this ImageJ plugin which is used as the primary analysis program in the lab. I reworked much of the program behind the hood, about ~50% new code, along with numerous new features I was directed to add by researchers in the lab. 

### Pulmonary Fibrosis Abstract
This abstract is for a manuscript I contributed to both the research and authoring of on during my time at The Centre For Heart Lung Innovation in the Hogg lab. 
The manuscript was subbmitted and accepted by the American Thoracic Society for review and publication.

## President of the UBC Water Polo Club

### 2020 UBC Water Polo Covid-19 Safety Plan
This safety plan was drafted for the fall 2020 between myself and the president of Vancouver Seniors Water Polo. This document integrated safety guidelines provided by the provincial goverment as well as the aquatic facility with the unique sport of water polo in mind.
